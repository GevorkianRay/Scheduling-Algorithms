# Scheduling Algorithms
Simulation of various Scheduling Algorithms in Java.
Includes:
1. First come first serve
2. Highest priority first (non pre-emptive/pre-emptive)
3. Highest priority first with aging (non pre-emptive/pre-emptive)
4. Round Robin
5. Shortest Job First
6. Shortest Remaining Time

Simulations aid in learning where certain scheduling algorithms are best used and the scenarios in which they should be considered.
